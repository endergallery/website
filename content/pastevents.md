### Exhibition Opening : May 8 1:00 pm CST (3:00 pm EST, 9:00 pm CEST)

Please join us for our first exhibition opening, as well as our first live event on the server!

(g)Ender Gallery is a solo exhibition of the work of Cat Haines, developed during her residency on the Ender Gallery Minecraft server. Combining photography, poetry, and monumental Minecraft builds, (g)Ender Gallery explores the platform’s potential for queer and trans intimacies. The exhibition is a playful transfeminist intervention into yonic art canon that uses worldbuilding as a means of trans agency. The body of work features a colossal reconstruction of the artist’s surgically-constructed vagina that contains a gallery of text and images that reflect upon moments of her transition. The project investigates the affordances of the Minecraft platform to reject a cisgender reading of transition, through recentering narratives of trans joy.

On Saturday May 8, at 1:00 pm Regina-time and 9:00 pm Berlin-time, ee will stream simulataneously to Haines's [personal twitch](twitch.tv/cat_moondyke), and the Mackenzie Art Gallery's social media, including its Facebook, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4xcsr3OMSuCxkdXRi0vZQ) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mackenzieartgallery) accounts. It will also be open for live guests to join us in Minecraft. In order to join in-game, attendees will need a licensed copy of Minecraft (Java edition)

### Open Studio : April 15 7:00 pm CST (6:00 pm EST, 3:00 am CEST)

On April 15, join Cat Haines and a special guest, Evie Ruddy, for a livestreamed open studio event where they will engage in an intimate conversation inside Haines’ Minecraft exhibit. Drawing on their art practices and scholarly work, Cat Haines and Evie Ruddy will discuss transfeminist and bodily interventions into second wave feminist theory, how each conceives of audience in their work, ways of disrupting cisnormative visual logics, and the role of affect in relation to desire. 

Evie Ruddy (they/them) ([@eviejohnny](https://twitter.com/eviejohnny)) is a socially engaged digital storyteller and PhD student in Cultural Mediations at Carleton University. As a PhD Fellow with Carleton’s Transgender Media Lab, Evie is helping to develop an online database of audiovisual works made by transgender, non-binary, Two Spirit, intersex, and gender non-conforming filmmakers. Evie is also researching the ethics of documenting trans bodies. They are particularly interested in the role of improvisation for fostering productive spaces for trans collaborators to exercise agency over how they are represented.
