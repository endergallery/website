Ender Gallery is an exhibition space and artist residency that exists inside the game Minecraft. 


## About the residency

We will stream simulataneously to Haines's personal twitch, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery's social media, including its Facebook, YouTube and Twitch accounts!

## Current Resident

Cat Haines (she/her) is a white genderqueer trans woman and dyke living on Treaty 4 Territory in Regina, SK. When she isn't playing Minecraft, Cat can be found pursuing a Master's degree in Women and Gender Studies at the University of Regina, with a thesis focusing on transmisogyny. Cat's artistic and academic projects often center and explore her gender, body, and subjectivities through queer, trans, and autotheoretical lenses.

Throughout her residency, Cat will be exploring the public consumption of trans women's bodies and genitals through a large scale Minecraft installation of her surgically constructed vagina and vulva. The project is meant to act as an ironic transfeminist intervention into the oftentimes cissexist construction of womanhood through feminist pussy art, as well as explore the possibility of queer and trans intimacies in digital spaces.
