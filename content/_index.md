Ender Gallery is an exhibition space and artist residency that exists inside the game Minecraft. 

## About the residency

Partnering with the [MacKenzie Art Gallery](https://mackenzie.art/) and curated by Sarah Friend, Cat Bluemke, and Jonathan Carroll, Ender Gallery is excited to host our first run of programming! We have four residencies planned for 2021, featuring Cat Haines, Simon M. Benedict, Huidi Xiang, and Travess Smalley.

## Current Exhibition

(g)Ender Gallery is a solo exhibition of the work of Cat Haines, developed during her residency on the Ender Gallery Minecraft server. Combining photography, poetry, and monumental Minecraft builds, (g)Ender Gallery explores the platform’s potential for queer and trans intimacies. The exhibition is a playful transfeminist intervention into yonic art canon that uses worldbuilding as a means of trans agency. The body of work features a colossal reconstruction of the artist’s surgically-constructed vagina that contains a gallery of text and images that reflect upon moments of her transition. The project investigates the affordances of the Minecraft platform to reject a cisgender reading of transition, through recentering narratives of trans joy.

Simon M. Benedict is an artist and translator of Franco-Québécois and Abenaki descent working with video, sound, still images, and text. He combines audiovisual material from various archives to examine how fictional and historical narratives inform and stem from our understanding of unmediated reality.

Recently, his video work has focused on depictions of Indigenous people in media made by and intended for non-Indigenous people. After spending much time and energy researching these harmful portrayals, he is relieved and excited to be doing something more positive and potentially healing within the context of Ender Gallery. During his residency time, Simon will be creating an environment inspired by “Kinaw8la – She Takes Care of You”, a booklet co-authored by Donna O’Bomsawin and Evelyne Benedict about native and non-native medicinal plants currently found on Odanak Abenaki territory.

Simon lives and works in what is now known as Toronto, the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendat. He hopes that this residency project will allow him to reflect on the spirit of the territory’s Dish with One Spoon treaty, which is based in the collective care and sharing of land and resources, and extends to all people living here today.
