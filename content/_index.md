Presenting Change Language Resource Pack, a solo exhibition by Travess Smalley. During his residency, Smalley has been developing a texture pack where the images and textures present in the game are replaced with randomly generated language. The result is a surreal reading experience, reminiscent of a concrete poem, that turns the familiar Minecraft world into an abstract, austere, and newly dangerous place (be careful identifying lava!). As a companion to the exhibition, Smalley will also be releasing the full resource pack for at-home players as well
