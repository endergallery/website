## About the residency

Partnering with the [MacKenzie Art Gallery](https://mackenzie.art/) and curated by Sarah Friend, Cat Bluemke, and Jonathan Carroll, Ender Gallery is excited to host our first run of programming! We have four residencies planned for 2021, featuring Cat Haines, Simon M. Benedict, Huidi Xiang, and Travess Smalley.

### Exhibition Opening : May 8 1:00 pm CST (3:00 pm EST, 9:00 pm CEST)

Please join us for our first exhibition opening, as well as our first live event on the server!

Presenting (g)Ender Gallery, a solo exhibition by Cat Haines. (g)Ender Gallery features a monumental reconstruction of Haines' surgically-constructed vagina that contains an art gallery of images and texts reflecting on and celebrating moments from her transition. The project is an ironic and playful transfeminist intervention into yonic art canon that centers trans joy and explores the possibilities of queer and trans intimacies in digital spaces.

On Saturday May 8, at 1:00 pm Regina-time and 9:00 pm Berlin-time, ee will stream simulataneously to Haines's [personal twitch](twitch.tv/cat_moondyke), and the Mackenzie Art Gallery's social media, including its Facebook, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm4xcsr3OMSuCxkdXRi0vZQ) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mackenzieartgallery) accounts. It will also be open for live guests to join us in Minecraft. In order to join in-game, attendees will need a licensed copy of Minecraft (Java edition) - we will post further instructions and the server address shortly before the event!

On April 15, join Cat Haines and a special guest, Evie Ruddy, for a livestreamed open studio event where they will engage in an intimate conversation inside Haines’ Minecraft exhibit. Drawing on their art practices and scholarly work, Cat Haines and Evie Ruddy will discuss transfeminist and bodily interventions into second wave feminist theory, how each conceives of audience in their work, ways of disrupting cisnormative visual logics, and the role of affect in relation to desire. 

Evie Ruddy (they/them) ([@eviejohnny](https://twitter.com/eviejohnny)) is a socially engaged digital storyteller and PhD student in Cultural Mediations at Carleton University. As a PhD Fellow with Carleton’s Transgender Media Lab, Evie is helping to develop an online database of audiovisual works made by transgender, non-binary, Two Spirit, intersex, and gender non-conforming filmmakers. Evie is also researching the ethics of documenting trans bodies. They are particularly interested in the role of improvisation for fostering productive spaces for trans collaborators to exercise agency over how they are represented.

## Current Resident

<img src="/Cat_Haines_Trans_Flag.png" alt="Screenshot of the Minecraft avatar of Cat Haines standing in front of a large trans flag built in Minecraft" class="full">

Cat Haines (she/her) is a white genderqueer trans woman and dyke living on Treaty 4 Territory in Regina, SK. When she isn't playing Minecraft, Cat can be found pursuing a Master's degree in Women and Gender Studies at the University of Regina, with a thesis focusing on transmisogyny. Cat's artistic and academic projects often center and explore her gender, body, and subjectivities through queer, trans, and autotheoretical lenses.

Throughout her residency, Cat will be exploring the public consumption of trans women's bodies and genitals through a large scale Minecraft installation of her surgically constructed vagina and vulva. The project is meant to act as an ironic transfeminist intervention into the oftentimes cissexist construction of womanhood through feminist pussy art, as well as explore the possibility of queer and trans intimacies in digital spaces.
